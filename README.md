# Google Forms URL Generator

It is an application that changes the user of Google Form that requires authorization to the specified URL

I answer with Google Form at school etc.  
I am troubled with being displayed as “Authorization is required” etc.  
However, I noticed that it is displayed correctly in the case of a shortened link, etc. and investigated it!  
I realized that it is possible to specify the user, and created this app.
